Hi, my English is poor, so... to the Masters of the Words... I only say that I am very SORRY, sincerly, i will do my better!

# Please, Do not use this repositories for production
Actually there is no guarantee with "master" branch, you could see the working advance on "Dev. Modele" Branch.
Thank you.

## What is "Modele"
This French strange concept "Modele" is based on Vagrant/Linux_Ubuntu_Server_X64_v14+/Apache2/PHPV_v5.6+/MySQL or MariaDB if it's impossible to use MySQL/Git_v1.9.1+/Node_v0.10.38... and a lot of others nice things for local development on Windows 8.1.

This local development will be construct to install environment system and network, database, dependencies, repositories, wordpress and front/back modules depends of your choices (bootstrap, Sass, gulp...) and finally offer to deploy with a maximum of facilities and great compatibilities with the actuals standards of web LAMP X64 machines.
